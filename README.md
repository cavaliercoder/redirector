# redirector

Redirector is a fast and lightweight HTTP server that serves a single purpose;
to redirect web clients from one URL to another. This is useful in the following
situations:

* URL shortening
* migrating from one URL layout to another
* vanity URLs

Redirector uses [BoltDB](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt), an embedded, high
performance key/value store to provide sub-millisecond responses, even when
managing millions of URL mappings.

This project is currently under active development and may require additional
contributions before it is production ready.


## Usage

```
# start web server
$ ./redirector serve

# add a URL mapping
$ ./redirector add \
	--key /abc123 \
	--dest http://my-site.com/some/path \
	--permanent

# test
$ curl -i http://localhost:8080/abc123
